            Guidelines for management of co-infection of COVID-19 with other seasonal epidemic prone
            diseases 
        </h2>
        <p>
            <h3>1. Background</h3>
        <p>
        Almost all States/UTs of the country are affected by COVID-19. Given the seasonal pattern of
        epidemic prone diseases observed every year in our country, it diseases like Dengue, Malaria,
        Seasonal Influenza, Leptospirosis, Chikungunya, Enteric fever, etc. can not only present as a
        diagnostic dilemma but may co-exist in COVID cases. This poses challenges in clinical and
        laboratory diagnosis of COVID , and have a bearing on clinical management and patient outcomes.


        </p>
        <h3>2. Scope</h3>
        <p>
        The scope of this document is to provide clear guidelines on prevention and treatment of co-infections
        of COVID with diseases like Dengue, Malaria, Seasonal Influenza (H1N1), Leptospirosis,
        Chikungunya etc.

        </p>
        <h3>3. Clinical features</h3>
        <p>
            As per the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition, a COVID case may present with:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Acute onset of fever AND cough;
                </li>
                <p>

                </p>
                <li>
                    Acute onset of ANY THREE OR MORE of the following signs or symptoms: fever, cough,
                    general weakness/fatigue, headache, myalgia, sore throat, coryza, dyspnoea, anorexia/nausea/
                    vomiting, diarrhoea, altered mental status.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <solid>OR</solid>
            </p>
            This case definition, although sensitive, is not very specific. Seasonal epidemic prone diseases, as
            cited in the foregoing paragraphs may all present as febrile illness, with symptoms that mimic
            COVID-19. If there is a co-infection, then apart from the febrile illness there may be constellation of
            signs and symptoms that may lead to difficulty in diagnosis. A comparative analysis of disease onset,
            symptoms, signs, warning signs, complications and diagnosis is given at Annexure.
        </p>
        
       <h3>4. Approach to diagnosis of suspected co-infection.</h3>
        <p>
            A high index of suspicion must be maintained for epidemic prone diseases (e.g. Dengue, Malaria,
            chikungunya, Seasonal influenza, Leptospirosis) prevalent in a particular geographic region during
            monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Bacterial co-infections must also be suspected in moderate or
            several cases of COVID-19 not responding to treatment.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Malaria/Dengue: It must be borne in mind that malaria/dengue can coexist with other infections,
                and thus confirmation of malaria/dengue infection does not rule out the possibility of the patient
                not suffering from COVID-19. Similarly, a high index of suspicion of malaria/dengue must be
                there when a fever case is diagnosed as COVID-19, particularly during the rainy and post rainy
                season in areas endemic for these diseases.
            </li>
            <li>
                Seasonal Influenza: Both COVID-19 and Seasonal Influenza present as Influenza Like Illness
                (ILI)/SARI, hence all ILI/SARI cases in areas reporting COVID-19 cases must be evaluated and
                tested for both COVID-19 and Seasonal Influenza, if both viruses are circulating in population
                under consideration.
            </li>
            <li>
                Chikungunya: Chikungunya presents with acute onset of moderate to high grade continuous
                fever and malaise followed by rash, myalgia and arthralgia. Respiratory failure may ensue in late
                stages. Co-infection with COVID-19 may be suspected in Chikungunya endemic areas, in the
                months of monsoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Leptospirosis: Leptospirosis apart from it presenting as febrile illness, has also the tendency to
                manifest as acute respiratory illness, leading to respiratory distress and shock. In areas where
                Leptospirosis is known to cause outbreaks during monsoon/ post monsoon, the possibility of coinfection should be considered.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scrub Typhus: Scrub typhus is known to be prevalent in foothills of Himalayas viz Jammu &
                Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Manipur, Nagaland, Meghalaya, etc. However, in recent
                past, scrub typhus outbreaks have also been reported from Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan,
                Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The clinical picture consists of
                sudden high-grade fever, severe headache, apathy, myalgia and generalized lymphadenopathy. A
                maculopapular rash may appear first on the trunk and then on the extremities and blenches within
                a few days. The patients may develop complications that include interstitial pneumonia (30 to
                65% of cases), meningoencephalitis and myocarditis. Scrub typhus infection may co-exist with
                COVID-19.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bacterial infections: Few patients with COVID-19 experience a secondary bacterial infection. In
                such cases, empiric antibiotic therapy as per local antibiogram needs to be considered.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>5. Diagnostics</h3>
        <p>
            While each of these infections are antigenically distinct with specific serological responses, yet in the
            eventuality of co-infections, cross-reactions (resulting in false-positive /false negative results) cannot
            be totally ruled out, especially if the testing kits used are not having requisite sensitivity and
            specificity. Hence the tests recommended by ICMR (for COVID-19) and that recommended by the
            concerned programme divisions (NVBDCP for vector borne diseases [Malaria, Dengue,
            Chikungunya]) and NCDC (Seasonal Influenza, Leptospirosis, Scrub Typhus)] needs to be followed.
            Availability of rapid diagnostic kits for malaria, dengue, scrub typhus should be ensured in such
            COVID treatment facilities.

                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Dengue Fever and COVID-19 share many pathogenic and clinical features which might make it very
                        difficult to differentiate the two infections (1). The phenomenon of ADE (Antibody Dependent
                        Enhancement) has been described for both dengue virus as well as for SARS-CoV-2 virus resulting in
                        escalation in degree of infection and number of complications. Both being RNA viruses they share
                        certain common features in pathogenesis, eventually leading to subsequent cytokines and chemokine
                        release and also affecting the integrity of the vascular endothelium leading to vasculopathy,
                        coagulopathy and capillary leak. Various mechanisms can explain the signs and symptoms observed
                        in co-infected patients but most will have the following, (i) Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE),
                        (ii) Cytokine Storm, (iii) Vasculopathy and (iv) Coagulopathy.

                    <li>
                        <h3>6.1.2 Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>
                            The clinical features of both the infections are overlapping, both present as acute febrile illness of
                            short duration and may have thrombocytopenia and shortness of breath, although respiratory
                            symptoms are more common in COVID-19 and bleeding manifestations more common in Dengue.
                            Routine testing for both diseases shows leucopenia or normal leucocyte count. Decrease in platelet
                            count which is a defining feature of dengue infection but can also be seen in significant number of
                            covid cases. There are reports in literature, where dengue serology was positive initially and later on,
                            it was found that cases were positive by RT-PCR for COVID-19 thereby suggesting that dengue
                            serology can be falsely positive in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, there is a need to rely on more
                            specific tests for each disease like throat swab RT-PCR for COVID-19 and ELISA based Dengue NS1
                            Antigen or serology test for dengue diagnosis. Serum sample for NS1 antigen within first 5 day of
                            onset of fever were negative in above study suggesting that positive dengue serology was more likely
                            to be false positive result and not co-infection. Hence, one needs to be careful while making diagnosis
                            of co-infection.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are now enough evidences to support that severe dengue is associated with cytokine storm and
                            high levels of various circulating cytokine are associated with poor outcome in most cases. COVID19 infects alveolar epithelial cells leading to pneumonia and ARDS, it also infects
                            monocytes/macrophages leading to cytokine storm associated with multi organ failure and death. This
                            cytokine storm seen in severe cases has led to increased use of steroids and other immunosuppressive
                            therapy in moderate to severe cases. 
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Both COVID-19 and Dengue infection are accompanied by coagulopathy and vasculopathy with
                            coagulopathy being predominant in formal leading to widespread use of Low Molecular Weight
                            Heparin (LMWH). There have been numerous evidences to suggest the increased burden of
                            thrombosis in COVID-19 based on which recommendations have been made for the use of LMWH in
                            moderate to severe cases. But in the presence of Dengue co-infection which is usually accompanied
                            by thrombocytopenia and increased risk of bleeding , the use of LMWH becomes a challenging issue.
                            Similarly, because of increased capillary leak and increased third space fluid loss, fluid administration
                            which forms the cornerstone in management of dengue might not be recommended with clarity as
                            conservative fluid administration has be

                        <p>
                            Following are some general measures to followed in case of Dengue and COVID-19 co-infection:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Co-infection should be ruled out when suspected with proper diagnostic method at the early stage
                                to initiate proper specific management to reduce morbidity and mortality.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Strengthening at the primary health care level is the key to manage dengue through early clinical
                                diagnosis and recognition of warning signs for severity of Dengue (such as abdominal pain or
                                tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleed, lethargy or
                                restlessness, liver enlargement >2 cm, and increase in haematocrit)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Mild to moderate Dengue and COVID co-infected patient should be monitored closely preferably
                                at hospital, as they may rapidly progress to severe stage therefore they should be referred to
                                higher centre at the early stage by recognizing warning signs. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                At the same time, all secondary and tertiary level hospitals should be prepared to manage severe
                                dengue and COVID cases. 
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                These measures will help to prevent the progression of illness to severe dengue and deaths, which in
                                turn will also help to reduce the number of patients that need to be referred to hospitals, thus avoiding
                                saturation of these facilities as well as the intensive care units.

                                Points related with specific therapeutic options and their use in cases with co-infection:
                            </p>
                            <li>
                                Fluid Therapy – Fluid therapy to be given in co-infection cases depends on hemodynamic status
                                of patient and degree of severity. One may follow national guidelines for clinical management of
                                dengue fever for most co-infection cases. It is only in the presence of SARI with COVID-19 that
                                we need to be careful with aggressive fluid administration as it leads to worsening of
                                oxygenation. Close clinical monitoring of fluid status is required in such cases. Aggressive fluid
                                resuscitation is recommended for COVID-19 patients in shock for initial resuscitation. 
                            </li>

                                LMWH – LMWH is being used and has been included in the National guidelines for the
                                management of moderate to severe covid-19 cases as it is associated with increased thrombosis.
                                Once the platelet count decreases to less than 1 lakh we need to be very careful with the use of
                                LMWH and it may be withheld based on clinical condition of the patient. Decision to administer
                                LMWH and the dosage for the same should be based on close monitoring with D-dimer
                                measurements. In any case of co-infection with active bleeding, LMWH needs to be stopped
                                immediately.

                                effective in severe covid-19 cases and have been recommended for the same. Dengue being a
                                viral illness, it’s course won’t be affected much. Hence, use of steroids can be continued as per
                                COVID-19 management guidelines

        <h3>6.2. Management of Seasonal influenza and COVID co-infection</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses has been described in a number of
            studies. Most prominent among these are Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Enteroviruses and Influenza A
            virus. With the approaching winter season, the seasonal Influenza cases may show an upward trend,
            and there could be cases of coinfection with COVID-19. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>6.2.1 Pathogenesis</h3>
                <p>
                    COVID-19 and Influenza share many pathogenic feature. Both diseases involve the respiratory
                    system, manifesting widely from ILI to SARI. Both diseases cause pneumonitis. The
                    histopathological manifestation of Interstitial inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage and intraalveolar edema followed by fibrin deposition, hyaline membrane, and leukocyte infiltration of the
                    alveolar septa are seen in both COVID and Influenza. The radiological appearance is not of much help
                    either as both diseases may have presence of opacities or consolidations.  
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Both being RNA viruses they share certain common features in pathogenesis, eventually leading to
                    subsequent cytokine release and acute respiratory distress syndrome
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>6.2.2 Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>
                    Whenever suspected, especially in areas reporting seasonal Influenza cases, samples should also be
                    sent and tested for SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>6.2.3 Clinical Features</h3>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    The clinical features of both the infections are overlapping, both present as acute febrile illness of
                    short duration and may have fever, cough and shortness of breath. Similarly, laboratory investigations
                    are also not very helpful in differentiating between the two, both show leucopenia or normal leucocyte
                    count. Co-infection should be ruled out when suspected with proper diagnostic method at the early
                    stage to initiate proper specific management to reduce morbidity and mortality.

                <p>
                    Points related with specific therapeutic options and their use in cases with co-infection:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The specific treatment as provided in the clinical management protocol of COVID needs to be
                        followed, as per severity of the disease
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <solid>
                            In addition to COVID management, for the treatment of influenza, Oseltamivir needs to be
                        administered in the prescribed dosages.
                        </solid>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In case of an outbreak of Seasonal Influenza outbreak, Oseltamavir blanket therapy should be
                        considered in all patients of COVID-19.
